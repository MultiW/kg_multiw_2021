## Algorithm

This project contains an algorithm that converts whole numbers (0, 1, 2, ...) into their phonetic equivalent. For example, given the list 1, 20, 345, the algorithm will return "One,TwoZero,ThreeFourFive".

It is implemented in JavaScript as a command-line program.

## Using the algorithm
Install Node.js and ensure that the ```node``` command is available in your command-line interface.

Use the algorithm as follows: ```node main.js <number> <number> ...```. For example: ```node main.js 1 20 345```.

The algorithm was tested on Ubuntu (WSL 2) with Node.js version 12.18.1.
