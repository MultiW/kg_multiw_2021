## Algorithm

This project contains an algorithm that converts whole numbers (0, 1, 2, ...) into their phonetic equivalent. For example, given the list 1, 20, 345, the algorithm will return "One,TwoZero,ThreeFourFive".

## Running the algorithm
Install Node.js and the ```node``` command.

Use the algorithm in the command line as follows: ```node main.js <number> <number> ...```. For example: ```node main.js 1 20 345```.

The algorithm was tested on Ubuntu (WSL 2) with Node.js version 12.18.1.
